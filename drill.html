				<p>Drills are used at every places of work whereever it requires constructions</p><br>
				<p>Just image if there were no drills, how would have been the holes created.</p><br>
				<p>But, nowadays with the advancement of technology, drills of strong metal quality are being made and many companies compete all around the world to provide with the best products and thses includes Addison, ITI and Miranda.</p><br>
				<p style="color:#E1B814;font-family: 'Special Elite', cursive;">Following are the two common type of drills.</p><br>

					<p style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue;font-family: 'Special Elite', cursive;">Center Drill</p>
					<p>Centre drills are usually double sided drills with a 60' stepped point, held in a drill chuck or collet chuck in a lathe. The purpose of the centre drill is to create an accurate centre hole in the face of a job so as a live centre can be inserted to support the weight and load of the job, whilst turning it.</p><br>
					<p>Longer jobs generally require a live centre from the tailstock of the lathe to support the job, which prevents chatter and run out.Centre drills can also be very useful in spotting or starting a precise hole, which will also give a chamfer on the hole; ideally used on the edge of round bar.</p>
					<p>Traditional twist drill bits may tend to wander when started on an unprepared surface. Once a bit wanders off course it is difficult to bring it back on center. A center drill bit frequently provides a reasonable starting point as it is short and therefore has a reduced tendency to wander when drilling is started.</p>

					<img style="float:left;" src="img/core.jpg" alt="Core Drill">
					<p style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue;font-family: 'Special Elite', cursive;">Core Drill</p>
					<p>A core drill is a drill specifically designed to remove a cylinder of material, much like a hole saw. The material left inside the drill bit is referred to as the core. Core drills used in metal are called annular cutters. Core drills used for concrete are generally called Diamond Core Drills and are water cooled.</p><br>
					<p>Core drills used in metal are called annular cutters. Core drills used for concrete are generally called Diamond Core Drills and are water cooled. For drilling masonry, carbide core drills can be used</p><br><br>
					<p>Core drills are used frequently in mineral exploration where the coring may be several hundred to several thousand feet in length. The core samples are recovered and examined by geologists for mineral percentages and stratigraphic contact points. This gives exploration companies the information necessary to begin or abandon mining operations in a particular area.</p>
